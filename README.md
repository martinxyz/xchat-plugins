# xchat-plugins
Some xchat (now hexchat) plugins I wrote and still use.

![screenshot of xchat running bigroom.py](/commented_screenshot.png?raw=true "bigroom.py")

* bigroom.py - highlight new questions, suppress or delay irrelevant join/part messages
* antiaway.py - don't highlight channel for away messages
